    <h2>Hello, I'm Shantanu Nikumbh 👋</h2>
    <p>
        I am an enthusiastic Engineering student and aspiring Full Stack Developer
        with strong interest in building real-world software solutions.
        I enjoy working with both frontend and backend technologies including
        MERN stack and Java.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I have worked on innovative projects like <b>Smart Traffic Light Automation using OpenCV and Arduino</b>
        and an <b>Android Health & Fitness Application</b>. These projects helped me understand
        how technology can solve practical problems in society.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I am also continuously improving my problem-solving skills by learning
        Data Structures and Algorithms in C++. My goal is to become a skilled
        software developer and contribute to impactful technological solutions.
    </p>
